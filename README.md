## November 2023 Reading Challenge


I possess a wandering mind, encountering various books each month. On occasion, I complete a book, while other times, my fleeting focus on a subject prevents me from doing so.
This month, I am reading Morning and Evening (Just 112 Pages!) by Jon Fosse. (Nobel Prize Winner in literature section, 2023). This is my first encounter with a piece of Norwegian literature. It is translated in English by Damien Searls.
